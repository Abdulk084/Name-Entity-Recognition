# Name-Entity-Recognition using BILSTM based on Tensorflow framework
Recognize named entities on Twitter with LSTMs
In this project, I used a recurrent neural network to solve Named Entity Recognition (NER) problem. NER is a common task in 
natural language processing systems. It serves for extraction such entities from the text as persons, organizations, locations, etc. 
In this project, I used the data from Twitter.



I used Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTMs)
